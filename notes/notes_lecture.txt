L01:

  What are the major compiler phases?
  ---
  Analysis and Synthesis.

  What is the difference between the analysis and synthesis phases?
  ---
  ??

  Why do we use intermediate code?
  ---
  So that code compilers can be split into front- and back-end components.

  What is the advantage of separating the front and back ends?
  ---
  You can mix and match instead of getting F*B - compilers.
  Some optimization is best performed on intermediate code.
  A different front-end might be better for debugging then the actual one that
  will be used in production.

  What is a lexeme?
  ---
  A string that corresponds to a token is called a lexeme.

  What is a token?
  ---
  Token i a symbolic name that sometimes has an attribute.

  What is a parse tree?
  ---
  A tree structure that spans all the tokens in a parsed statement.

  What is a abstract syntax tree?
  ---
  An AST tree only spans the essential structure and tokens in a parsed
  statement. Used inside of the compiler. Often representant by a typed
  object-oriented model.

  What is a intermediate code?
  ---
  Type of simple assembly-code that is platform and language independent.

  What is the difference between assembly code, object code and executable
  code?
  ---

  What is bytecode?
  ---
  A form of platform independent language that is read by a VM implemented for
  the specific target platform.

  What is an interpreter?
  ---
  It is the software that executes the high/low level program.

  What is a virtual machine?
  ---
  A type of interpreter that executes platform independent (byte)code.

  What is a JIT compiler?
  ---
  Stands for Just In Time compilation. Combines ahead of time compilation with
  interpretation. Suitable for dynamic programming languages.

  What kinds of errors can be caught by a compiler?
  ---
  Lexical errors, Syntactic errors, Static-Semantic errors.

  What is a lexical error?
  ---
  Text that cannot be interpreted as a token.

  What is a syntactic error?
  ---
  Tokens are presented in the wrong order.

  What is a static-semantic error?
  ---
  The usage of name/types/etc. is not correct.

  What kinds of errors can be caught by a run-time system?
  ---
  null pointer exceptions, division by zero, stack overflow, etc.

  Differences between a safe and unsafe language?
  ---
  A safe system catches and reports all runtime errors. Unsafe system might
  perform undefined behaviour.

L02:

  What is a alphabet?
  ---
  A finite and non-empty set of symbols.

  What is a string?
  ---
  A string is a finite sequence of symbols.

  What is a formal language?
  ---
  A formal language consists of a set of possibly infinite strings.

  When is regular expressions used?
  ---
  Regular expressions are used to parse tokens.

  When is context-free grammar used?
  ---
  Context-free grammar is used when building syntax trees.

  What is attribute grammars?
  ---
  Attribute grammars consist of context-free grammar with additional rules to
  constrict it further.

  When is attribute grammars used?
  ---
  ???

  What is a regular expression?
  ---
  They are equivalent to finite automata (finite-state machines).

  What defines a deterministic finite automata?
  ---
  Each transition is uniquely determined by the input.

  What is meant by an ambiguous lexical definition?
  ---
  If a string and it's substrings match several defined rules it's ambiguous.

  Example of typical ambiguities and how they can be resolved?
  ---
  "<" matching for '<='. Resolve with longest match and rule order priority.

  What is lexical action?
  ---
  The thing that happens when a match is found. Example, execution of Java
  code.

  What is NFA?
  ---
  Non-deterministic Finite Automata.

  What is DFA?
  ---
  Deterministic Finite Automata.

  What is the difference between NFA and DFA?
  ---
  A DFA has disjoint character sets for all outgoing edges, in NFA they can
  overlap. A DFA can't have epsilon/"" edges, a NFA can have empty edges.

  Construct an NFA given lexical definition.
  ---
  ???

  How to construct a DFA from an NFA?
  ---
  ???

  How to implement DFA in Java?
  ---
  Table driven implementation or switch based.

  How is rule priority handled in implementation of DFA?
  ---
  ???

  What are lexical states?
  ---
  Different sets of token definitions.

  Why are lexical states useful?
  ---
  Can switch out the DFA to another set to handle ex. multiline comments.

L03:

  Construct a CFG for a simple part of a programming language.
  ---

  What is a symbol?
  ---
  Symbols include both terminal and non-terminal words to the right in the CFG.

  What is a non-terminal symbol?
  ---
  Non-token symbols that are defined by the grammar.

  What is a terminal symbol?
  ---
  A symbol corresponding to a token.

  What is a production?
  ---
  A production corresponds to X -> s_1, s_2, ... where s are non-/terminal
  symbols. X is non-terminal.

  What is a start symbol?
  ---
  One non-terminal symbol, usually the left hand side of the first production.

  What is a parse tree?
  ---
  Tree that contains all the nodes. Non-terminal nodes are internal nodes and
  terminal nodes are leafs.

  What is a left-hand side of a production?
  ---
  The left side of the arrow. X -> s1, s2, ...

  What is a right-hand side of a production?
  ---
  The right side of the arrow. X -> s1, s2, ...

  What does L(G) mean if G is a grammar?
  ---
  Alp. T, T* -> possible sequences on T. L(G) -> subset of T* that can be
  constructed using start symbol S and production rules P.

  Derivation step?
  ---
  Using a production rule to replace a token with the corresponding result.

  A derivation?
  ---
  Derivation is a sequence of derivation steps.

  A leftmost derivation?
  ---
  When replacing the leftmost non-terminal -> left derivation.

  A rightmost derivation?
  ---
  When replacing the rightmost non-terminal -> right derivation.

  Relationship derivation <--> parse tree?
  ---
  A derivation corresponds to building a parse tree.

  Ambiguous CFG?
  ---
  When a sentence can be derived to different parser trees.

  Unambiguous CFG?
  ---
  A sentence can only be derived into a unique parser tree.

  Example of an ambiguous CFG?
  ---
  "Exp + Exp * Exp" with Exp -> Int | Exp -> Exp + Exp | Exp -> Exp * Exp

  Significant for LL parser?
  ---
  Parses left->right, Leftmost derivation. Builds a parse-tree from the top,
  easier to understand than LR parser, but weaker.

  Significant for LR parser?
  ---
  Parses left->right, Rightmost derivation. Builds a parse-tree from the
  bottom. Harder to understand than LL parser but more powerful.

  Difference between LL(1) vs LL(2)?
  ---
  LL(1) uses one look-ahead token and builds a construct after seeing the first
  token of its sub-tree.

  Difference between LR(1) vs LR(2)?
  ---
  LR(1) uses one look-ahead token and builds a construct after seeing the fist
  token following its sub-tree.

  Construct a recursive decent parser for a simple language.
  ---

  Grammar that cannot be handled by recursive decent parser?
  ---
  Left recursion??

  Why is context free grammar more powerful than regular expressions?
  ---

  What is "context-free"?
  ---
